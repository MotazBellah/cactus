# Cactus App
A web application for tracking the child's growth, just enter your child's weight, height (length), and head circumference, and we'll calculate a percentile for each. That's a number reflecting what percentage of kids is larger or smaller. Doctors watch these numbers over time to make sure your child is growing in a healthy way.
